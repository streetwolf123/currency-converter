# currency-converter

## Description

Currency converter that uses many currencies and the ability to change each of them, after entering the amount and selecting the currency, we can click on the **calculate** button
then at the bottom after the inscription *result:* the result of the operation will be displayed. The field for entering the amount has a protection that does not allow to calculate the value of the currency
if the field is empty or a number is not entered but a letter or letters are entered, the window in this situation will be highlighted in a similar red color.
The **calculate** button has a pseudo-class *hover* set which exposes the click when hovering over it.

## look 

The appearance has been kept simple, a *border* has been added which exposed the calculator itself a bit and it took on a slightly more decent look.
